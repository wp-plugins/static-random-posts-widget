<h4>Admin Refresh Options on a Post</h4>
If you are logged is as admin and are viewing a post, you will see a "Refresh" button beneath where the random posts are displayed.  You can click this "Refresh" button and automatically refresh your random posts.

If you use WP Super Cache, clicking "Refresh" also clears the cache so your users can see the new random posts immediately.  

The "Refresh" feature is useful for those who have long refresh times, but want to tweak the output a bit.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would someone want "static" random posts? =

In my opinion, it's a usability enhancement to a website.  I've found myself browsing sites that have random posts listed.  Sometimes I want to view more than one of those posts in the sidebar, but when I click on one, the whole thing refreshes.

Having the random posts remain static for a period of time gives the user the opportunity to browse all of the random posts present.

Furthermore, having the random posts static for a time may aid in SEO.

= What's the "Refresh" feature for? = 

Say, for example, you have the refresh rate set for sixty minutes.  You look at the current random posts, but aren't impressed with what's showing.  You can click "Refresh" until a suitable line-up of posts are displayed.
